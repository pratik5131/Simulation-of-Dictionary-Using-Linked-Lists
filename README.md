# Simulation-of-Dictionary-Using-Linked-Lists
Simple C Project. Created a Simulation of a Dictionary using single linked lists. Also demonstrated the usage of pointers, arrays etc. 
It is a very simple menu driven program and itâ€™s totally based on the application of Single linked list.
The only limitation of our program is that there is no deletion function so we can just add meanings in it not delete it.
No Frontend Technology is used
